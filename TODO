HIGH priority

* test suite






MEDIUM priority

* Machine readable input/output (JSON?)

* -p "page mode" for touching, evicting, or locking just a range of pages in
  a file... same format as nmap -p. 4k-50k, 1.5G-2G, -5M, -

* Try opening large mappings with MAP_HUGETLB on linux 2.6.32+

* From Dennis (Apr 2012):
  "Additionally you might want to use MAP_NORESERVE for the mmap, this seems to speed things a bit up for multiple huge files."





LOW priority

* Continually call mincore() every time a residency chart is drawn

* In daemon mode, make fatal errors go to syslog.
