HIGH priority

* test suite






MEDIUM priority

* Machine readable input/output (JSON?)

* Try opening large mappings with MAP_HUGETLB on linux 2.6.32+

* From Dennis (Apr 2012):
  "Additionally you might want to use MAP_NORESERVE for the mmap, this seems to speed things a bit up for multiple huge files."





LOW priority

* Continually call mincore() every time a residency chart is drawn

* In daemon mode, make fatal errors go to syslog.
